When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you have to colaborate with other people in the same project you need a remote repository
  rather than a local one.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	When working with branches that depend in the actual state of the local repository, that maybe won't work with the
	updated remote repository.
