When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you have to colaborate with other people in the same project you need a remote repository
  rather than a local one.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	When working with branches that depend in the actual state of the local repository, that maybe won't work with the
	updated remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	A fork is just a copy of another github hosted project (a feature of github) its useful when you
	whant to modify a public project for your own purposes, clone is to copy a repository
	wherever it is in github, in a private server or in local, and is useful to clone when you need to
	have a local version to workin and colaborate with others. And a branch is just another path of a repository
	that may be a test, an idea from a coder within the project and she doesn't want that her changes affect
	the base project so she choose her own path without disturbing others.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	the benefit of having a copy of the las known state of the remote stored locally is that we
	have all changes that other people do. So, if other people is working in something, and we are working
	in something else that depends on that if we "copy" that changes from others in our local repo,
	we could continue to working with all the necesary.
