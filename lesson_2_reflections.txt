What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When a repository is initialized with command "git init" a hiden folder
	called .git is created, in it is stored all the information about the
	the history of the documents that there are in the parent folder of .git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?
	
	The staging area is the area when are placed the files that we want git to track.
	the working directory may have a lot of others files that we use for testing
	or just for play with the program but the staging area contains the files that
	are really important to the project and we want to make a history of them.
